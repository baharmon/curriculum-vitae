abstract = {This study uses Danxiashan, a world heritage site in Guangdong province, China, as a case study for planning a hypothetical geotourism network of heritage sites. This landscape has a multiplicity of values—its geoheritage cannot be separated from its ecological or cultural heritage. When designing a network of heritage sites for such a diversely valued landscape trade-offs must be made between differing and potentially conflicting objectives such as geotourism and geoconservation. To solve this multi-criteria decision problem, sites with potential value for people were designated as heritage sites, adapting the concept of geomorphosites—i.e., geomorphological heritage sites—to represent the intersection of anthropic values. In a GIS-based spatial decision support system heritage values for each site were weighted and ranked using the analytic hierarchy pro- cess and scenarios for alternative trail systems, and networks of tourism sites were generated by multi-criteriamapoverlay analysis and networking algorithms. The scenarios generated show how trade-offs can be made between oft-conflicting tourism and conservation objectives, how the design of parks can be optimized for multiple objectives, and how alternative design strategies can be explored. Such an approach could be used in scenario planning workshops to engage stakeholders in participatory design and consensus- based decision-making driven by geospatial science.},

abstract = {Military installations and cities in the twenty-first century share many of the same dynamics and face many of the same challenges – i.e. the same environmental, climatic, and anthropogenic pressures. The military response to these challenges is, however, constrained by hierarchy and the culture of command and control. In a city, informal adaptations, experiments and solutions can arise to pressing urban issues that were unanticipated or unanswered by the formal city. By contrast, decisions and solutions in military installations have traditionally come down the chain of command. In an ever more complex world in which the future is ambiguous and change is a certainty, top-down decision making and the predictive sciences, alone, will not be enough to ensure a sustainable future. Cities and military installations will need to be adaptable and resilient to survive the complex, ever- changing, and uncertain threats of the future.},

abstract = {With emerging technologies landscape architects can begin to intuitively model and creatively design dynamic, evolving landscapes. Advances in geospatial modeling, remote sensing, rapid prototyping, and 3d scanning are changing the way that landscapes are modeled. Now we can generate dynamic landscape form with process-based scientific models. We can build precise physical models using remote sensing and rapid prototyping. And we can link physical and digital models with real-time 3d scanning. Our new technology — Tangible Landscape — enables designers to intuitively sculpt a physical model of a landscape coupled with a digital model in a real-time feedback loop of 3d scanning, geospatial modeling, and projection. This bridges the digital-analog divide by combining the kin\ae sthetic creativity of traditional modes of design with the analytics and procedural dynamism of geospatial modeling.},

%abstract = {We present new advances in the development of Tangible Geospatial Modeling System (TanGeoMS), an exploratory environment for analysis of relationships between elevation surface morphology and dynamic landscape processes. The system integrates digital terrain data and a flexible physical model with GRASS GIS-based analysis and simulation tools. The physical model can be modified by hand and scanned to create digital representations of altered landscapes within a GIS. The results of topographic analysis and GIS-based simulations applied to the modified landscape are then projected over the physical model, providing the users with feedback about the impact of the changes on the terrain parameters or modeled processes. The new prototype system replaced the costly laboratory laser scanner with a Kinect-based solution, making the system affordable, lighter and more flexible, while providing adequate accuracy and scanning speed. Advances in 3D printing and new modeling materials extended the techniques for building the physical models from a carved foam with plasticine surface to 3D printing or moulding from polymer-enriched sand for rapid 3D sketching. We demonstrate the system applications for analysis of terrain change impacts on selected processes in natural and engineered landscapes, and for testing simulation algorithms in various landscape configurations. The examples include overland water and sediment transport patterns modeled by standard flowrouting and unit stream power based method and by a robust particle sampling algorithm. Coastal terrain inundation and dynamics of solar irradiation under changing topographic conditions is also explored. The demonstration examples highlight the TanGeoMS application for collaborative explorations, communication of terrain change impacts and testing of algorithms for dynamic land surface process simulations.},

abstract = {While free and open source software becomes increasingly important in geospatial research and industry, open science perspectives are generally less reflected in universities' educational programs. We present an example of how free and open source software can be incorporated into geospatial education to promote open and reproducible science. Since 2008 graduate students at North Carolina State University have the opportunity to take a course on geospatial modeling and analysis that is taught with both proprietary and free and open source software. In this course, students perform geospatial tasks simultaneously in the proprietary package ArcGIS and the free and open source package GRASS GIS. By ensuring that students learn to distinguish between geospatial concepts and software specifics, students become more flexible and stronger spatial thinkers when choosing solutions for their independent work in the future. We also discuss ways to continually update and improve our publicly available teaching materials for reuse by teachers, self-learners and other members of the GIS community. Only when free and open source software is fully integrated into geospatial education, we will be able to encourage a culture of openness and, thus, enable greater reproducibility in research and development applications.},

abstract = {We present a new, affordable version of TanGeoMS, a tangible geospatial modeling and visualization system designed for collaboratively exploring how terrain change impacts landscape processes. It couples a physical, three-dimensional model of a landscape with geospatial modeling and analysis through a cycle of scanning and projection. Multiple users can modify the physical model by hand while it is being scanned; by sculpting the model they generate input for modeling of geophysical processes. The modeling results are then visualized by projecting images or animations back on the physical model. This feedback loop is an intuitive way to evaluate the impacts of different scenarios including anthropogenic and natural landscape change. Integration with GRASS GIS, a free and open source geographic information system, provides TanGeoMS with a variety of easily accessible geospatial analysis and modeling tools. To demonstrate the environmental modeling applications of TanGeoMS, we will demonstrate how development can be planned based on feedback from landscape processes such as hydrologic simulation and wildfire modeling with variable fuel distribution.},

abstract = {We present TanGeoMS, a tangible geospatial modeling visualization system that couples a laser scanner, projector, and a flexible physical three-dimensional model with a standard geospatial information system (GIS) to create a tangible user interface for terrain data. TanGeoMS projects an image of real-world data onto a physical terrain model. Users can alter the topography of the model by modifying the clay surface or placing additional objects on the surface. The modified model is captured by an overhead laser scanner then imported into a GIS for analysis and simulation of real-world processes. The results are projected back onto the surface of the model providing feedback on the impact of the modifications on terrain parameters and simulated processes. Interaction with a physical model is highly intuitive, allowing users to base initial design decisions on geospatial data, test the impact of these decisions in GIS simulations, and use the feedback to improve their design. We demonstrate the system on three applications: investigating runoff management within a watershed, assessing the impact of storm surge on barrier islands, and exploring landscape rehabilitation in military training areas.},
